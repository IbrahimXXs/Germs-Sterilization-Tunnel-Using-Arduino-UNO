# Germs Guard Sterilization Tunnel

## Overview
### Sterilization Tunnel is a motion-activated sanitization gateway designed to provide an additional layer of protection against viruses and germs.

### The project was developed using TinkerCAD Simulation, allowing for a virtual representation of the system.

#### Components

* PIR Sensor (Passive InfraRed): The PIR sensor detects motion, triggering the sanitization process when movement is detected.

* Bread Board: Provides the platform for connecting and prototyping the circuit.

* Arduino UNO: The microcontroller responsible for processing sensor inputs and controlling the output devices.

* Wires: Connect various components on the breadboard, ensuring a proper electrical connection.

* Red & Green LEDs: Indicate the status of the sanitization process. Red LED is activated when no motion is detected, while the green LED is activated during the sanitization process.

* DC Motor: The motor is activated when motion is detected, contributing to the overall sanitization effect.

* Resistors: Used to limit current flow and protect LEDs from burning out.

#### Project Setup

Motion Detection:

The PIR sensor detects motion in its vicinity.
Sanitization Process:

Upon detecting motion, the system activates the green LED, indicating the sanitization process is active.
No Motion Detected:

If no motion is detected, the red LED is activated, signaling that the sanitization process is inactive.
Motor Activation:

The DC motor is activated during the sanitization process, contributing to an effective sanitization effect..
